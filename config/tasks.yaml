clarify_requirements_task:
  description: >
    Engage with the user to clearly define the research topic: '{topic}'.

    Your goal is to remove ambiguity and lock down a precise research brief.
    Explicitly determine:
    - Scope boundaries (what is included and excluded)
    - Desired depth (high-level overview vs deep technical analysis)
    - Target audience (engineers, leadership, researchers, mixed)
    - Time relevance (recent only or historical context allowed)
    If information is missing, ask focused clarifying questions.
    If sufficient information exists, finalize the research brief.

  expected_output: >
    If sufficient information exists:
    - Acknowledge readiness to proceed
    - Provide a concise summary of the understood requirements
    - Produce a finalized, concrete research questions
    - List assumptions and exclusions explicitly
    - Confirm initiation of the research phase


    If insufficient information exists:
    - Ask only the minimum necessary clarifying questions max 2 questions

research_plan_task:
  description: >
    Create a clear, execution-ready research plan for the topic '{topic}'.

    This plan will be followed STRICTLY by another agent, so it must be concrete,
    explicit, and operational.

    HARD REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW):
    - Break the topic into AT LEAST 5 distinct research areas
    - Each research area MUST represent a different angle
      (e.g., technical feasibility, economic impact, adoption timeline,
       regulatory constraints, role-specific impact)
    - For EACH research area, explicitly state:
      - What needs to be answered
      - Why it matters
      - How many web searches are required (minimum 1 per area)
    - Avoid vague verbs such as "explore", "understand", or "look into"

    You are NOT doing research here.
    You are designing a plan that enforces depth.

  expected_output: >
    A structured MARKDOWN research plan with the following sections:

    ## Research Objective
    ## Research Areas (minimum 5)
    For each area:
    - Research Question
    - Key Aspects to Investigate
    - Required Number of Web Searches
    - Preferred Source Types
    ## Definition of Sufficient Research
    - Clear conditions that must be met before research is considered complete

conduct_research_task:
  description: >
    Execute the research EXACTLY according to the approved research plan.

    This task is expected to perform DEEP research, not a quick overview.

    NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
    - You MUST perform AT LEAST 5 separate web searches using the search tool
    - Each search MUST be a distinct Serper tool call
    - Each search MUST address a different research area from the plan
    - You are NOT allowed to stop early, even if information seems repetitive

    EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Identify the research areas defined in the research plan
    2. For EACH research area:
       - Perform the required number of web searches
       - Use different, specific search queries
    3. After EACH search:
       - Summarize only factual findings
       - Clearly link findings back to the research area
    4. After completing ALL searches:
       - Summarize what is well-covered
       - Explicitly list any remaining uncertainties or gaps
    5. Never procced further without doing tool calls.

    SOURCE QUALITY GUIDELINES:
    - Prefer official reports, standards bodies, benchmarks, and academic sources
    - Industry reports are acceptable if clearly cited
    - Blogs or opinion pieces must be explicitly labeled as such

    TOOL USAGE:
    - Use search_tool for all searches
    - Use scrape_tool ONLY if a page contains dense, high-value content
      that cannot be captured from search snippets alone

  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive MARKDOWN research report containing:

    ## Research Execution Summary
    - Total number of searches performed (must be ≥5)

    ## Research Findings by Area
    For each research area:
    - Search Queries Used
    - Sources Consulted
    - Key Findings (facts only)

    ## Cross-Cutting Insights
    - Patterns or consensus across sources

    ## Remaining Gaps and Uncertainties
    - Clearly stated unanswered questions or weakly supported areas

  agent: deep_researcher

write_report_task:
  description: >
    Write a professional, well-structured research report on '{topic}'
    using ONLY the findings produced during the research execution.

    The report must follow a standard technical research structure
    commonly used in industry and academic surveys.

    STRICT RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
    - Do NOT introduce new facts, sources, or assumptions
    - Base all statements strictly on the conducted research
    - Maintain a neutral, analytical, and evidence-driven tone
    - Clearly distinguish between observed facts and inferred insights

    The goal is to produce a report that can be reviewed by
    engineers, researchers, or decision-makers without ambiguity.

  expected_output: >
    A structured MARKDOWN report with the following sections:

    ## 1. Executive Summary
    - Concise overview of the topic
    - Key conclusions drawn from the research
    - High-level implications

    ## 2. Research Scope and Approach
    - What was studied and why
    - How the research was conducted
    - Types of sources consulted (e.g., documentation, benchmarks, papers)
    - Total number of web searches and sources reviewed

    ## 3. Detailed Findings
    - Organized by the research areas defined in the research plan
    - Factual findings with clear explanations
    - Inline references to sources where applicable

    ## 4. Cross-Cutting Insights
    - Patterns or trends observed across multiple sources
    - Areas of agreement or disagreement in the literature

    ## 5. Limitations and Open Questions
    - Data gaps or weakly supported areas
    - Constraints encountered during research
    - Topics requiring further investigation

    ## 6. References
    - List of all sources cited
    - Each reference must include a working URL

    No Comments or Explanations just mark down report.
